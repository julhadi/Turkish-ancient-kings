The soliders presented his wife.Cenonito asked his wife about the baby.His wife said,"The father of this baby is my one and only love Jullu.I cannot live without him.
I love him more than my life.I just want to leave you and also this kingdom.Please leave me alone".The great Cenonito became angry.He ordered his soliders to find out Jullu and present him in front of him.
The soliders went to find Jullu but they could not find him.Then Cenonito killed his wife by cutting her head.<br>
On the other side,Jullu is also a king.He has his own palace.On a war,Cenonito's father killed Jullu's father.To take the revange,Jullu did all those things.
He shooted Cenonito and also saved him so that Cenonito make him friend.Then he did physical relation with his wife whom he loved most.Then he get back to his kingdom.<br>
